# Statistical Quality Control of Pretzel Manufacturing Process

This project applies statistical process control (SPC) and process capability analysis to a pretzel manufacturing process. Using real production measurements, the study evaluates whether the system is operating under statistical control and assesses its ability to meet engineering specifications.

The project was completed in Winter 2023 as part of a Quality Control and Improvement course.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on monitoring critical-to-quality characteristics in pretzel production, including:

- Continuous measurements such as pretzel length  
- Attribute data such as breakage and surface defects  
- Phase I and Phase II control charting  
- Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals  
- Distribution fitting and normality assessment  
- Process capability metrics  
- CUSUM and EWMA charts for detecting small shifts  

The goal is to demonstrate how quality engineers detect assignable causes, evaluate process stability, and guide manufacturing improvements.
